										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ten years ago, &#8220;the Gate&#8221; appeared and connected the real world with the realm of magic and monsters. To combat these vile beasts, ordinary people received superhuman powers and became known as &#8220;Hunters.&#8221; Twenty-year-old Sung Jin-Woo is one such Hunter, but he is known as the &#8220;World&#8217;s Weakest,&#8221; owing to his pathetic power compared to even a measly E-Rank. Still, he hunts monsters tirelessly in low-rank Gates to pay for his mother&#8217;s medical bills.</p>
<p>However, this miserable lifestyle changes when Jin-Woo—believing himself to be the only one left to die in a mission gone terribly wrong—awakens in a hospital three days later to find a mysterious screen floating in front of him. This &#8220;Quest Log&#8221; demands that Jin-Woo completes an unrealistic and intense training program, or face an appropriate penalty. Initially reluctant to comply because of the quest&#8217;s rigor, Jin-Woo soon finds that it may just transform him into one of the world&#8217;s most fearsome Hunters. </p>
